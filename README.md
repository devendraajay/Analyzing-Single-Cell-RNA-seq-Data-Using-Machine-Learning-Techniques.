# Analyzing-Single-Cell-RNA-seq-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.

# Project Overview.

This project would include a comprehensive study into the high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data using advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the scRNA-seq of cellular diversity and underlying biological mechanisms. The analysis of such data will be done using dimensionality reduction techniques and graph-based models, through which insights may be obtained into the extremely intricate structure that exists in the single-cell level gene expression data.

# Project Structure
data/: It stores raw and processed scRNA-seq datasets for analysis.

src/ Pre-trained models and scripts for training Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

visualization_data/: Data visualizations, model performance metrics, etc.

README.md: A brief overview of the project, the structure and how to run the analysis.
