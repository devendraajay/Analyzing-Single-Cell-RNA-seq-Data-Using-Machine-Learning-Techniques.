# Analyzing-Single-Cell-RNA-seq-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.

#Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze and interpret high-dimensional scRNA-seq data to uncover cellular heterogeneity and underlying biological processes. By applying dimensionality reduction techniques and graph-based models, we aim to provide insights into the complex structure of gene expression data at a single-cell level.
