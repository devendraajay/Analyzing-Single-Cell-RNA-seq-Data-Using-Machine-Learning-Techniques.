# Analyzing-Single-Cell-RNA-seq-Data-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.

# Project Overview.

This project would include a comprehensive study into the high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data using advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the scRNA-seq of cellular diversity and underlying biological mechanisms. The analysis of such data will be done using dimensionality reduction techniques and graph-based models, through which insights may be obtained into the extremely intricate structure that exists in the single-cell level gene expression data.
